1. Clone the repository locally
2. open index.html file in browser.
3. The application redirects to upload a csv file, pull one for eg. from project root folder, as testFile.csv. It contains comma seperated numbers, with next set of comma separated numbers in next line.

5. The application is developed in pure javascript, html and css.
